.. _predicate-language:

Predicate Logic
***************

The Logika predicate logic input language is a small
extension of the :ref:`propositional-language` input language
where the additional language elements are:
(1) :ref:`uninterpreted-functions`,
(2) :ref:`quantified-claims`,
(3) :ref:`revised-assumptions`,
(4) :ref:`pred-rules`.

Similar to the discussion in the :ref:`propositional-language` input
language chapter, this chapter only discuss
Logika's rendition of predicate logic natural deductions;
the reader is referred to :ref:`predicate-logic` for intuitive
discussion on predicate logic.

**Predicate Logic Input Language Grammar**

.. _predicate-1:

.. literalinclude:: predicate.txt
   :language: antlr
   :lines: 1

The predicate logic input language is similar to that of
:ref:`propositional-language` input language, where it consists
of a sequent and the sequent's proof. Here is an example that is
also a `syllogism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism>`__:

.. literalinclude:: predicate-1.logika
   :language: none

In the subsequent description, only language elements that are new
or extend the :ref:`propositional-language` input language are
discussed. The complete predicate logic input language is
given in the :ref:`pred-grammar` section as a reference.

Extended Claim Expressions
==========================

.. literalinclude:: predicate.txt
   :language: antlr
   :lines: 32 - 43
   :emphasize-lines: 4, 10 - 12

Similar to :ref:`propositional logic claim expressions <prop-claim>`,
the predicate logic claim expressions are untyped.
One can take the view that all variables in Logika's predicate logic
language are of integer type and
all predicates/functions accepts only integers and returns an integer, where
zero is treated as ``⊥`` and non-zero as ``⊤``.
Integers are desirable in this context instead of booleans because
it allows one to quantify over (infinitely) many objects
instead of only two.

At any rate, the claim expression language in Logika's
predicate logic has two additional kinds of expression:
(1) predicate/function applications, and (2) quantified claims,
as highlighted above, and described next.


.. _uninterpreted-functions:

First-Order Uninterpreted Predicate and Function Applications
-------------------------------------------------------------

.. literalinclude:: predicate.txt
   :language: antlr
   :lines: 65, 35, 10 - 11

A predicate is a function that returns either ``⊤`` or ``⊥``.
In predicate logic, the meaning of each function is unspecified,
thus, uninterpreted.

Instead of depending on function interpretations,
Logika's predicate logic reasoning uses
:ref:`rewriting/substitution techniques <pred-rules>`, in addition to
:ref:`structural equivalence <structural-eq>` (``≡``)
that is used in propositional logic.
The techniques depend on the fact that each function is
pure, meaning that it produces the same result
when given the same arguments regardless of how many times
it is applied (invoked/called).

A predicate is applied by referring to its
identifier followed by some ordered arguments (optional)
which are separated by a comma (``,``) and delimited by a
parenthesis, such as shown in the
:ref:`syllogism <predicate-1>` example above.

Predicates have to always be supplied with arguments whenever
referred. This makes it easy to distinguish whether an identifier is
a predicate, e.g.,:

.. literalinclude:: predicate-2.logika
   :language: none

In this popular syllogism,
``Socrates`` is distinguishably a variable (intuitively, it points
to Socrates the person, which is mechanically modeled using
an integer object made up from ``1``\ s and ``0``\ s), but
``human`` and ``mortal`` are predicates (which intuitively,
classify whether an object is a human and a mortal, respectively).

In Logika, all functions are first-order, i.e., they
do not accept function values as arguments. Note that this
does not preclude functions to accepts results of other functions,
as illustrated in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: predicate-3.logika
   :language: none

As can be observed, the ``gt`` predicate can accepts results of
applying functions ``inc`` and ``dec``.
(By the way, the example uses uninterpreted functions/predicates
to model properties of integer arithmetic operators
due to the lack for
:ref:`algebra <algebra>` support in Logika's predicate logic;
it is supported in :ref:`programming logic <programming-language>`
instead.)

Furthermore, Logika functions cannot be overloaded;
each is only associated with exactly one signature.
In Logika's predicate logic, the signature is
only determined by the number of its arguments; hence,
each function has a fixed number of arguments.


.. _quantified-claims:

Universally (∀) and Existensially (∃) Quantified Claims
-------------------------------------------------------

.. literalinclude:: predicate.txt
   :language: antlr
   :lines: 63, 41 - 43

Logika's quantification form can be used to quantify
over multiple variables at once (followed by a
claim expression), which means the same as if one
quantifies over the variables one by one in the same order.
For example,
``∀x ∀y p(x,y)`` is semantically equivalent as ``∀x,y p(x,y)``;
however, for simplicity, they are not considered as structurally equivalent, i.e.,
``¬(∀x ∀y p(x,y) ≡ ∀x,y p(x,y))`` or ``∀x ∀y p(x,y) ≢ ∀x,y p(x,y)``.

Well-Formed-ness
----------------

For simplicity, Logika does not allow identifier "shadowing",
which means that a variable cannot be quantified more than one time in the
same scope.
For example, ``∀x (… ∧ ∀x …)`` is ill-formed in Logika, but
``(∀x …)  ∧  (∀x …)`` is well-formed.

In general, ``x ∧ ∀x …`` is well-formed, because the first variable ``x`` is
different than the quantified variable ``x``.
The first ``x`` is a *free* variable because it is not
defined/quantified in the expression where it is referred,
while the second ``x`` is defined in the quantification.

However, to avoid confusion, Logika disallows such claim expression.
This is because, in the context of a sequent and its proof, all free variables
are actually *implicitly universally-quantified* (even for propositional logic).
In that sense, disallowing the same identifier used for as both free and quantified
is consistent with the restriction of disallowing identifier shadowing.

Abstract Notation
-----------------

One abstract notation that is used from now on is to express that a claim
``R`` that refers to some free (in the context of ``R`` itself) variables
such as ``a`` and ``b``, by delimiting the list of variables in
a square bracket after ``R``, e.g.,: ``R[a, b]``.
In this notation, the order appearance of variables ``a`` and ``b``
do not matter.
For example, one can abstract ``∀x,y p(x,y))`` as ``∀x,y Q[x,y]`` or
``∀x,y Q[y,x]`` because both just say that the claim ``Q`` refers
to both ``x`` and ``y``.


Thus, in general, when defining a quantification, it is either one of the
following forms:
``∀a1,...,aN P[a1,...,aN]`` (universal), or
``∃a1,...,aN P[a1,...,aN]`` (existensial).
That is, all the quantified variables appear in the claim (most preferably).
This is not a requirement, but it is not useful to introduce
a quantified variable without ever using it in the claim.
